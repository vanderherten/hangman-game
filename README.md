# HANGMAN GAME

Hangman Game is a Python terminal game, which runs in a mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can test their knowledge of english vacabulary. The game will allow the user to choose the word length they would like to play. They have a choice from four to nine letters. The user gets six lives to try to guess the secret word. A scoreboard will be visible with the user's high score and current max score. The game will give the user the option to get a hint, the word synonyms, when only one life remains. If the user loses, the secret word will be revealed and the player can opt to get the word's definition. These extra features added to the classic game, gives the user an educative experience while playing this Hangman Game. The game also allows the user to replay the game to increase their high score, which adds a fun and competitive element as well.
